hdd.img contains a whole disk with an msdos partition table
if we want to mount the partition with linux, we need to specify
the offset where it begins

the get this offset, open the image with parted and to the following:
type 'unit' <enter>
type 'B' <enter>
now we have Bytes as a measurement unit
type 'print' <enter>
read the value at 'Start' of the desired partition and use this value as
the offset value in the following mount command:

mount -o loop,offset=32256 -t vfat hdd.img /mnt/partition
